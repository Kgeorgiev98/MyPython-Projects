# MyPython-Projects
Hello, my name is Kristian.
This repository is where I'm going to upload my Python projects, while I'm studying Python at home.
Here is what my projects do:

-The btcprice_checker is a project which retrieves the current price of BTC and shows it as a Windows notification with a custom icon. It can be automated. 
It makes use of the .png file I have uploaded.

-The apply_1977_filter lets the user choose an image, apply my favourite filter to it and then choose where to save it as a default .jpg file, it also automatically opens it for the viewer to  see!

-You can try out my version of the HangMan game, it has built in UI and you can play with your mouse!
