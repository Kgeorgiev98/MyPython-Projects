My Python projects
Hello, my name is Kristian. This repository is where I'm going to upload my Python projects, while I'm studying Python at home.
The btcprice_checker is a project which retrieves the current price of BTC and shows it as a Windows notification with a custom icon. It can be automated.
The apply_1977_filter lets the user choose an image, apply my favourite filter to it and then choose where to save it as a default .jpg file, it also automatically opens it for the viewer to  see!
